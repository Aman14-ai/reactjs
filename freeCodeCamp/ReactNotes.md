##  JSX is a syntactic sugar on top of the create element and under the hood react is taking this jsx syntax and turning it into calls to create element 

# *   what makes react so great: 
*       reusability of code.
*       compatibility of code.
*       React is declarative: can lean on library to handle the manual ,tedious task that we otherwise we have to worry about ourselves.
