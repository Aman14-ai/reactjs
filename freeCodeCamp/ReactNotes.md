##  JSX is a syntactic sugar on top of the create element and under the hood react is taking this jsx syntax and turning it into calls to create element 

# *   what makes react so great: 
*       reusability of code.
*       compatibility of code.
*       React is declarative: can lean on library to handle the manual ,tedious task that we otherwise we have to worry about ourselves.

#   What does it mean for something to be 'declarative' instead of 'imperative'
*   Imperative means we need to give specific step-by-step instructions to accomplish any task.
*   Declarativd means we can write our code to simply describe what should show on up page and allow the tool react to handle the details on how to put those things on to the page.

#   What does it means for something to be 'composable'
*   we have some small pieces that we can put together to make something larger or greater than the individual pieces themselves.
